        <br>

    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em><b>I. Foster the creative habits of mind</b></em></p>
  <p><p style="font-family: Verdana">Although there are still many coding concepts I want to acquire and improve upon, I have learned to be grateful. Not only for the progress I have made, but the privilege of having access to the valuable resources this class provides (and the skills it teaches). Digital composition was a field I knew absolutely nothing about. However, I now know that new media and digital design have essential extensions to many fields (such as philosophy and the sociopolitical sector). I learned that although you can put days/weeks of dedication into a project, it may not always come out as you intended. This curriculum makes me apply multidisciplinary skills in a way I never have- I appreciate this challenge.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em><b>II. Engage with others in a workshop environment</b></em></p>
  <p><p style="font-family: Verdana">I have a fear of public speaking, and although our class is extremely small, putting my work “out there” for people to critique was nerve-racking. Collaborating with my peers allowed me to recognize my flaws/weaknesses in design (such as using more reader-friendly fonts) and helped me diminish my anxiety when presenting. For me, it was extremely insightful to work in a community-based collaborative environment. My group was able to help one another “tweak” elements that weren't working correctly, give each other encouragement, and offer new ideas that weren’t previously thought of. I think it's important to think of one another as a tool. If we combine our knowledge and experience I’m thinking we can produce some pretty incredible things. Although my knowledge in this field is quite limited, I'm looking forward to helping others to the best of my ability.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em><b>III.	Think deeply about craft</b></em></p>
  <p><p style="font-family: Verdana">I completely scrapped my original Branching Webtext Design project, not only because my theme was loosely connected to the readings, but because I realized it didn’t reflect the substantial amount of time I spent thinking about the concepts from this class. I was so focused on framing my projects around some general final project theme that I lost touch with the new creative outlooks I had developed. I definitely need to begin finalizing a definitive goal for my project and formulating a distinctive/objective craft (it’s difficult for me because this class makes me question larger/universal concepts). I might focus on the ability of media to incite emotions such as fear in a way that's distant from human nature. I also think it's really interesting that we can combine computer science (concrete elements) and intangible elements (those without limits/bounds)- a concept I plan to “toy” with in future projects.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em><b>IV. Engage in sustained research and skills development </b></em></p>
  <p><p style="font-family: Verdana">The progression of these three projects allowed me to continuously review my work and acquire perseverance (a new-found dedication to developing my craft). For my branching web text design, I needed to conduct research not only to develop a comprehensive understanding of what an existential crisis actually is, but recognize how to communicate this concept to others. Reading blogs about people’s personal struggles with identity allowed me to connect with their stories and prompted me to use more of an interactive approach for the setup of my site.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em><b>V. Learn to present your work</b></em></p>
  <p><p style="font-family: Verdana">My praxis was to explore the diverse and limitless bounds of digital composition and construct projects that express my creativity. I aimed to design sites that would visually draw the user in without being overwhelming. Specifically, I wanted to focus on finding a balance between creativity/ accessibility while connecting material from class to a subject matter relevant to my personal life. Living in this post
Covid era has been difficult for many people, and I feel as though we as a society tend to ignore/filter out our feelings, emotions, or questions about life as a whole. My branching design was a therapeutic, learning process that I created to help others know they are not alone.</p>

  <h4><em>I. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p><p style="font-family: Verdana">Although my B-roll and Photo Essay don’t necessarily meet my personal standards for a coherent/stylistically correct, polished, and creative final product, for my Theater/Performance in Latin America project, I was able to create an experimental, mixed-media video using all of the techniques I learned from this class. I love how I can take these skills and apply them interdisciplinarily! Experimenting with Character Animator actually led me to finalize my project conjecture and provided a platform for combining educational and creative elements- exactly what I needed! I tried to find an online construction worker puppet that I could download, but none existed so I had to create my own character. After conducting research and watching tutorial videos, I discovered my own method of making. I created my own artwork in Photoshop, discovered new tools (how to draw), and designed multiple layers to achieve my desired product. After my puppet video was complete, I realized I needed to learn a better method for voice animation-editing (how to get my voice to sound masculine/deep) so I also taught myself Adobe Audition.</p>

     <br>
        <h4><em>II.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p><p style="font-family: Verdana">Without collaborating with both Dr. Quigley and my classmates, I wouldn't have been able to develop my skills or final project idea nearly as much as I have. I learned that verbalizing my Stasis theory in a collaborative setting each week is the best way to discover a precise plan. For me, my concepts were scattered, but bouncing ideas off of one another helped me pinpoint the essential elements and learn what aspects of my project intrigued others- those ideas are the ones I included. Criticism and constructive feedback were essential. Dominic and I were able to give Emily ideas about her layout and presentation to help in the transition from theory to practice. We recommended using a vertical scrolling element for learning about the different layers of the earth. For Dominic, we focussed on areas of research and content as I brainstormed new events to possibly include in his timeline. Dominic gave me some great technological tools, hacks, and websites that have substantially aided my learning process and time management.  Additionally, Lorenzo helped me create better dimensions in Premiere Pro by inserting a black video as my first element and gave me the idea to utilize drone shots- something I never would’ve thought of. By actively engaging in a classroom setting that inspires creativity and personal growth, we were able to build upon/further develop one another’s projects (allowed us to see areas we were lacking in and introduce fresh perspectives/innovative ideas).</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>III.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p><p style="font-family: Verdana">I wanted to center my later makings around my final project idea- that way I can see what works/doesn't work and constantly revise/improve my craft. For the interview, I attempted to focus on achieving quality sound, lighting, and the proper angle for personability and emotional connection with the interviewees (I rented equipment from Hillman to make this happen). I used the three-point lighting strategy and incorporated elements from the Roland Barthes’ Camera Lucida reading to create a precise, clear, and well-lit video, even if that meant rearranging my entire living room. This was the first time I've ever used a professional video camera, audio recorder, or any of the Adobe applications (Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro, etc.). Just learning how to use these tools required time, dedication, and many different rounds of edits. Through Premiere Pro and After Effects, I was able to construct a basis for my project's “visually exciting home page”. I will build upon them to focus on user experience and engagement (ex. including a button “click to start your journey”). Through Character Animator, I realized that I wanted my project to combine the Joseph Campbell Hero Cycle and an educational pick-your-own journey. Additionally, creating all of these makings helped me specify which Normans Interactive Design Principles I will include: Affordances/Constraints (giving the audience two path/route options, Introduction to Change page), Signifiers: (Buttons: Press the “Clinic” to continue your journey, footprints that track the user's progress).</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>IV.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p><p style="font-family: Verdana">I deeply struggled with discovering and finalizing my project conjecture. I wanted to research something I thought was meaningful and could actually help educate my audience or make an impact. Initially, I wanted my project to discuss workplace mistreatment: sexual assault, dangerous environments, psychological harm, and understaffing. As well as the political reform that's necessary to implement change within each subject. However, as I dove deeper into my research, I realized this field is way too complex and intertwined. I needed to focus on a specific, definitive subject to clearly get a point across and to think smart/plan accordingly so my project would be attainable given the time allotted. I decided to narrow in on hazardous environments within the construction industry, a topic that isn’t widely discussed. I had to constantly revise, rewrite, and replan many different project drafts, but completing research every week greatly aided my revision process and allowed for deeper thinking. I used my interview as a basis for different problematic cases and unique viewpoints (experiences within an industry dominated by a single voice). Through gathering data, I discovered that statistics and first-hand accounts are extremely effective at communicating a message- the two main elements I will utilize in my final project.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>V. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p><p style="font-family: Verdana">The process of taking the time to learn how each application works, its components, and layout allowed me to consciously think about which affordances I could utilize to make my final project accessible to a wide range of users. I was able to theorize an idea and discover a plan to achieve it. For example, learning how to create unique title sequences in After Effects gave me the idea of including a Dyslexia friendly font (Decodable text) throughout my entire project. Additionally, working in Character Animator, I learned that it's essential to subtitle/build in an audio aid component, especially since videos make up half my project (an affordance we take for granted with youtube). I wanted to make a puppet that was accessible to a diverse age range so I gave “Joey” a more cartoon based appearance that would peak the interest of children/young adults. However, this prototype was a great start in helping me create my ideal puppet- I will be using a more abstract/mature cartoon to engage adults as well. Additionally, creating all of these makings helped me define a clear conceptual model for my final project map so users are familiar with how to interact with my kiosk.</p>
